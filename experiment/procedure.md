### Procedure

**1.  Output Characteristics using meters:**

a)  Click on ‘Make connections’ icon.

b)  A table listing all the terminals pops up. This a simple series circuit. Click on each ‘From’ terminal one after the other.

c)  Observe the simultaneous connection being formed.

d)  Once all the terminals are connected, click on ‘Connections Completed’ icon.

e)  ‘Switch- ON’ the main supply.

f)  ‘Switch- ON’ the Gate-to-Drain supply.

g)  Click on ‘Start Experiment’.


**On the Experiment page:**

a)  Click on the Resistance icon- ‘R’ to set the load.

b)  Set the initial Gate-to-Source voltage ‘V<sub>GS</sub>’ using slider.

c)  Set the main supply voltage (V<sub>in</sub>) using the slider.

d)  Keep changing the main supply using the slider till table is filled.

e)  Click on ‘Plot’ to trace the characteristics.

f)  Repeat Steps-2 to 5 for a total of 5 values of Gate-to-Source voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>).


**2.  Output Characteristics using probes and oscilloscope:**

a)  Click on ‘Make connections’ icon.

b)  A table listing all the terminals pops up. This a simple series circuit. Click on each ‘From’ terminal one after the other.

c)  Observe the simultaneous connection being formed.

d)  Once all the terminals are connected, click on ‘Connections Completed’ icon.

e)  ‘Switch- ON’ the main supply.

f)  ‘Switch- ON’ the Gate-to-Source supply.

g)  Click on ‘Start Experiment’.


**On the Experiment page:**

a)  Click on the Resistance icon- ‘R’ to set the load.

b)  Set the initial Gate-to-Source voltage ‘V<sub>GS</sub>’ using the slider.

c)  Vary the Main voltage (V<sub>in</sub>) using the “V<sub>in</sub>” slider.

d)  Click on ‘Plot’ to trace the characteristics.

e)  Repeat Steps-2 to 4 for a total of five values of Gate-to-Source voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>).


**3.  Transfer Characteristics:**

a)  Click on ‘Make connections’ icon.

b)  A table listing all the terminals pops up. This a simple series circuit. Click on each ‘From’ terminal one after the other.

c)  Observe the simultaneous connection being formed.

d)  Once all the terminals are connected, click on ‘Connections Completed’ icon.

e)  ‘Switch- ON’ the main supply.

f)  ‘Switch- ON’ the Gate-to-Source supply.

g)  Click on ‘Start Experiment’.


**On the Experiment page:**

a)  Click on the Resistance icon- ‘R’ to set the load. 

b)  Set the Gate-to-Source voltage ‘V<sub>GS</sub>’ to threshold voltage ( V<sub>T</sub>) using slider.

c)  Set the Main/Supply voltage (V<sub>in</sub>) using slider such that Drain-to-Source voltage (V<sub>DS</sub>) is set to 50 V.

d)  Keep changing the Gate-to-Source Voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>) till the table is filled.

e)  Click on ‘Plot’ to trace the characteristics.
