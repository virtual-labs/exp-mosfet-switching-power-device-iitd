### To study the performance characteristics of MOSFET:

##### a) Output Characteristics (Drain current-vs-Drain-to-source voltage).

##### b) Transfer Characteristics (Drain current-vs-Gate-to-source voltage).

##### c) Switching Characteristics (Switch Current and Switch Voltage pattern during turn- ON/OFF transitions).
